                    Building your own home is one of the most rewarding things you can do for yourself and your family.
                    There are so many advantages to a custom home build and so many reasons to take on this challenge. 
                    However, if you have ever looked into the cost of building a home, you know how expensive it can be. 
                    That's why building a shipping container home is such a great option. <br><br>
                    A container home is a great way to get all the luxaries of a custom home without the expense.
                    With the alternative housing movement booming, there has never been a better time to start. 
                    In this article, we have put together everything you need to know about building a shipping container home.
                    By understanding the basics, you can decide if it is the right choice for you.

                    <h2 >What does the work involves </h2>
                </div>

        <div>
                    <p > 
                    
                    The first thing that needs to come out is the flooring of the container, an insecticide
                    infused wood that can cause long term health issues for someone living inside as a normal home.
                    You will need windows and other openings cut into it (two images side by side make an effective 
                    living space) and where these holes are cut you need to reinforce the structure. 
        <br><br>
                Insulation against the elements is another factor – air con can be very expensive and even though 
                    insulation adds to the initial costs, the cheaper the home will be to run long term. 
                    Once it has been designed, cut and welded together the home can be dropped onto inexpensive 
                    footings – a concrete pad often suffices. The build can be extremely quick and where it comes to self-building, speed saves money.
