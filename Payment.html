                <li>Upon successful creation of the Pay Later Instalment Payment Plan, 
                    Cardmember will be billed the first month instalment amount in his
                    /her monthly credit card statement. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Subsequently, Cardmember will be billed the instalment amount on a
                     monthly basis until the end of the repayment period. 
                </li>

                <li>

                    the amount of instalment payments received by the Bank.

                    card statement and is not received by CBE Bank in full by the payment
                     due date, the prevailing late fees and/or finance/interest charges on
                      the outstanding amount(s) will apply.

                <li>
                    Cardmembers who choose to cancel their existing instalment plan will be
                     charged an early termination fee of 2000 br /per Pay Later Instalment Payment Plan. 
                </li>

                    In the event that the CBE Credit Card is terminated by Cardmember, any
                    Pay Later Instalment Payment Plan that is currently financed through the Card will be 
                    accelerated and made payable immediately. Additionally, an early termination

                     Later Instalment Payment Plan will not be automatically terminated by the Bank. Cardmember 
                    would need to contact and instruct the Bank to terminate the instalment plan if 
                    he/she wishes to do so. Early termination fee will be waived for merchant-refunded transactions. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Customer will have to ensure that the merchant-refund have been credited into the
                     respective CBE Credit Card account before instructing the Bank to cancel instalment 
                     plan. If any outstanding instalment payment that was due in Cardmember’s 
                    monthly credit card statement and is not received by CBE Bank in full by the payment
                     due date, Cardmember will be liable for the prevailing late fees and/or finance/interest
                      charges on the outstanding amount(s)."
