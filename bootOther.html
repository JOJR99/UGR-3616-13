                    Telecom service was introduced in Ethiopia by Emperor Menelik II in 1894 during the commencement 
            of the telephone line installation from Harar to Addis Ababa. Then the inter-urban network was expanded 
            in all other directions from the capital and many important centers in the Empire were interconnected by landlines to 
            facilitate long-distance communications with the help of intermediate operators acting as verbal human repeaters.</p>
