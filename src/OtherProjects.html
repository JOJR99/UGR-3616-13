    <p>Telecom service was introduced in Ethiopia by Emperor Menelik II in 1894 during the commencement <br>
        of the telephone line installation from Harar to Addis Ababa. Then the inter-urban network was expanded <br>
        in all other directions from the capital and many important centers in the Empire were interconnected by landlines to <br>
        facilitate long-distance communications with the help of intermediate operators acting as verbal human repeaters.</p>
