        However, if you have ever looked into the cost of building a home, you know how expensive it can be. <br>
        That's why building a shipping container home is such a great option. </p>
<p>

    <h2>WHAT DOES THE WORK INVOLVES</h2>
    <p>The first thing that needs to come out is the flooring of the container, an insecticide 
        infused wood that can cause long term health issues for someone living inside as a normal home.
        You will need windows and other openings cut into it (two images side by side make an effective 
        living space) and where these holes are cut you need to reinforce the structure. </p>

        <p>Insulation against the elements is another factor – air con can be very expensive and even though 
            insulation adds to the initial costs, the cheaper the home will be to run long term.
            Once it has been designed, cut and welded together the home can be dropped onto inexpensive 
            footings – a concrete pad often suffices. The build can be extremely quick and where it comes to self-building, speed saves money. </p>
